hfsprogs for Debian
-------------------

This package currently only provides mkfs.hfs (mkhfs) and fsck.hfs
(hfsfsck).  In the future, it may provide more tools from the Darwin
sources, such as a utility to tune a filesystem, like disabling the
journaling of the filesystem.

It includes a patch from from Gentoo, as described in their wiki:
