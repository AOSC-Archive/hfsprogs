  * debian/changelog: fix typo on Adam's name.
  * debian/control: include "amd64" as a 64 bit target architecture.

hfsprogs (332.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: include more 32-bit architectures as requested
    (Closes: #469151). Despite the fact that there is already a new
    upstream version, I plan on having it be a team-managed package.

hfsprogs (332.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: restrict the number of architectures to i386 and powerpc,
    since the package is not 64 bit clean (compiling on amd64 with option -m32
    is under study for a future version of the package). See for reference bug
    #436159 which originated the discussion and for which this is a workaround
    to be addressed properly later.
