hfsprogs (332.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: restrict the number of architectures to i386 and powerpc,
    since the package is not 64 bit clean (compiling on amd64 with option -m32
    is under study for a future version of the package). See for reference bug
    #436159 which originated the discussion and for which this is a workaround
    to be addressed properly later.
