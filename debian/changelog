hfsprogs (332.14-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/changelog: fix typo on Adam's name.
  * debian/control: include "amd64" as a 64 bit target architecture.
  * debian/control: include "hppa mips mipsel s390" 32 bit target
    architectures (Closes: #482070).
  * debian/control: include "m68k" as another architecture.
    (Tks: Gerfried Fuchs)
  * debian/rules: include detection of amd64 and pass information to build
    process. Warning: the kernel needs to have support/emulation for 32 bit
    applications enabled. (Tks: Adam Cécile)
  * debian/rules: uses $(CURDIR) instead of $(PWD) as per lintian hint.
  * debian/{lintian-override,rules}: create a lintian override for the
    license (only the packaging is GPL, not the entire source code).

hfsprogs (332.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: include more 32-bit architectures as requested
    (Closes: #469151). Despite the fact that there is already a new
    upstream version, I plan on having it be a team-managed package.
  * Update to new Debian Policy Standard (no changes).

hfsprogs (332.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: restrict the number of architectures to i386 and powerpc,
    since the package is not 64 bit clean (compiling on amd64 with option -m32
    is under study for a future version of the package). See for reference bug
    #436159 which originated the discussion and for which this is a workaround
    to be addressed properly later.
